# SIN5006-StockManipulation
Repository for the SIN5006 discipline project developed in the 1st semester of 2025. Based on the article "Stock Price Manipulation Detection using Variational Autoencoder and Recurrence Plots". Link: https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650234
This article proposes a different approach to detect stock price ilicit manipulation using Recurrence Plots and beta Variational Autoencoders. It demonstrated efficient results compared to other approaches. I used this article to reproduce its approach and try to reach similar results
